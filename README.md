Project Description

The application accepts numerical input from the user and stores it in a single-dimensional array.
It performs operations such as sum, average, maximum, and minimum on the data.
The program also sorts the array manually without using built-in sorting methods.
Additionally, a multi-dimensional array example is included to demonstrate matrix-style data storage.
